# Webpack Serve Node Env

This repo was created to help reproduce this [issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/1991#issue-731239700).

## How to use

The webpack config will print the environment variables at the start.

You can try the different scripts but none of them seems to set NODE_ENV properly.  
Ex: `npm run start1`
